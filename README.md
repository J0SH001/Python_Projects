# Python_Projects
 This is where I'll keep all of my Python practice projects. I anticipate a lot more functions, I wonder how different this will be from JavaScript.

Conclusion: There were a lot more functions and was quite similar to JavaScript but I think Python is easier to use/understand. In this course I made multiple applications ranging from one's that will sort through and rearrange files on my computer to relatively simple games that filtered user input to interactive applications running they're own databases with Django and some with Tkinter.
